    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 24 year old programmer living in Los Angeles. My favorite
things are mathematics, programming, and my dog Griffin ❤️</p>
<p>I graduated from UCLA in 2021 with a Bachelor's in Mathematics
and a specialization in computing. My favorite area of math is
mathematical logic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel's Incompleteness
Theorems</a> are some of the coolest things ever and you should totally
check them out :) . The proof of the first one is particularly
beautiful, if you haven't seen it already.</p>
<p>My most-used language is Python. I've written Python code for
stuff like data processing/analysis (mostly numpy/pandas), deep
learning (pytorch), backend functionality and endpoints, web scraping,
among other things. Libraries/tools I am experienced with are numpy, pandas,
pytorch, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, sqlite, selenium, among others.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of familiarity with Javascript/Typescript and web
development. I have written a good deal of React code, for tasks ranging
from user interfaces to communicating with the backend, synchronizing
frontend state with backend state, etc. I have worked with React
frameworks like NextJS, as well as base React and component libraries
like Material UI.</p>
<p>Other languages I am familiar with (in no particular order): Java,
C++, C#, Matlab, HTML/CSS, Haskell (functional programming is cool!), R.</p>
<p>Some more stuff about me: I speak (ok-ish) Finnish, I know a lot
of random trivia about airplanes and I love Greyhounds. My current
dog, Griffin, is a three year old retired race Greyhound. He's my
best friend!</p>
<p>Here's a picture of me

Here's a picture of Griffy with one of his holes :)
