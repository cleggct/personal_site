# Rebuilding My Personal Site With 11ty
I recently redesigned my personal site again, this time switching
to using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> to build my site.
I really like 11ty for the reason that it does a really good job of
getting out of the way and letting you focus on designing your site
without having to worry about wrangling with your build tools. For
a site that's mostly just pure HTML/CSS, I find that 11ty is ideal
because it allows you to write powerful templates consisting of pretty
much just raw HTML/CSS, while also giving you lots of control over how
those templates are applied to the site content. This way, you never
have to rewrite the same HTML code anywhere and you can write templates
to generate pretty much any kind of content you want. For me, 11ty is the
perfect middle ground between the power and flexibility that comes with
using a really big and fancy web development framework like react, and
the simplicity of just working in HTML/CSS.
