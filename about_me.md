# About Me
I'm a 24 year old programmer living in Los Angeles. My favorite
things are mathematics, programming, and my dog Griffin ❤️

I graduated from UCLA in 2021 with a Bachelor's in Mathematics
and a specialization in computing. My favorite area of math is
mathematical logic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel's Incompleteness
Theorems</a> are some of the coolest things ever and you should totally
check them out :) . The proof of the first one is particularly
beautiful, if you haven't seen it already.

My most-used language is Python. I've written Python code for
stuff like data processing/analysis (mostly numpy/pandas), deep 
learning (pytorch), backend functionality and endpoints, web scraping,
among other things. Libraries/tools I am experienced with are numpy, pandas,
pytorch, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, sqlite, selenium, among others.

I also have a lot of familiarity with Javascript/Typescript and web 
development. I have written a good deal of React code, for tasks ranging
from user interfaces to communicating with the backend, synchronizing
frontend state with backend state, etc. I have worked with React
frameworks like NextJS, as well as base React and component libraries
like Material UI.

Other languages I am familiar with (in no particular order): Java,
C++, C#, Matlab, HTML/CSS, Haskell (functional programming is cool!), R.

Some more stuff about me: I speak (ok-ish) Finnish, I know a lot
of random trivia about airplanes and I love Greyhounds. My current
dog, Griffin, is a three year old retired race Greyhound. He's my
best friend!
